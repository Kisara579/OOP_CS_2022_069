## 📋 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive lab worksheet solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming course. Each lab worksheet (LW) focuses on different OOP concepts and programming techniques using Java.




### LW_01: Basic Java Programming

Introduction to Java programming fundamentals including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Circle class implementation
- Problem-solving exercises (Q1-Q5)

### LW_02: Control Structures & Methods

Focus on control flow and method implementation:

- Conditional statements
- Loops and iterations
- Method definitions and calls
- Problem sets (Q1-Q7)

### LW_03: Classes and Objects

Deep dive into object-oriented concepts:

- **Q1:** Temperature conversion system
- **Q3:** Bicycle and Owner relationship
- **Q4:** Course management system (Lecturer, Student, Course)
- **Q5:** Library management system (Book, BorrowableItems, Person, Student)

### LW_04: Advanced OOP Concepts

Advanced programming techniques and patterns:

- Comprehensive problem sets (Q1-Q12)
- Complex algorithm implementations
- Design patterns and best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions)

### Running the Programs

1. **Clone the repository:**
