## 📋 Overview

This repository contains comprehensive lab worksheet solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming course. Each lab worksheet (LW) focuses on different OOP concepts and programming techniques using Java.

### LW_01: Basic Java Programming

Introduction to Java programming fundamentals including:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Circle class implementation
- Problem-solving exercises (Q1-Q5)

### LW_02: Control Structures & Methods

Focus on control flow and method implementation:

- Conditional statements
- Loops and iterations
- Method definitions and calls
- Problem sets (Q1-Q7)

### LW_03: Classes and Objects

Deep dive into object-oriented concepts:

- **Q1:** Temperature conversion system
- **Q3:** Bicycle and Owner relationship
- **Q4:** Course management system (Lecturer, Student, Course)
- **Q5:** Library management system (Book, BorrowableItems, Person, Student)

### LW_04: Advanced OOP Concepts

Advanced programming techniques and patterns:

- Comprehensive problem sets (Q1-Q12)
- Complex algorithm implementations
- Design patterns and best practices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- A Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extensions)
- MySQL Connector/J (for database-related labs)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Download MySQL Connector/J:**

   - Visit [MySQL Connector/J Downloads](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
   - Download version 9.5.0 or compatible version
   - Extract the downloaded archive

2. **Setup the connector:**
   - Create a `Resources` folder in the project root directory
   - Place the extracted `mysql-connector-j-9.5.0` folder inside `Resources/`
   - Your structure should be: `Resources/mysql-connector-j-9.5.0/`

### Running the Programs

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kisara579/OOP_CS_2022_069.git
   cd OOP_CS_2022_069
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired lab worksheet:**

   ```bash
   cd src/LW_01
   ```

3. **Compile a Java file:**

   ```bash
   javac Q1.java
   ```

4. **Run the compiled program:**
   ```bash
   java Q1
   ```
